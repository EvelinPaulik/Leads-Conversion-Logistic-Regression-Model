Binary Logistics Regression for Sales Leads Dataset

This Leads Dataset is taken from the marketing dataset of X Education, an online education company that sells courses to industry professionals.

X Education has marketing for their courses online, across several websites and different search engines such as Google, Facebook, and organic search. Users who land on the website can browse through the courses, watch videos, or fill out a form with their information. Thus when the form is filled out, these people become a potential client or customer but one that hasn't yet been qualified as a prospect. They are then contacted by the sales team via email or phone, and this process is recorded in the data.

The company has noticed that only a few of these leads get converted into actual customers, while most do not. Typically, less than 1/3 of these prospects become customers.

In order to make the process more efficient, X Education wants a way to identify leads which have the most potential, utilizing the given data. This will be done by creating a binary logistics regression. This will predict which class a unit will fall into when there are only two class options - Converted or Not Converted.

The full dataset can be found on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/ashydv/leads-dataset.

More information on the column values can be found in the data folder under Leads Data Dictionary.
